Hi, I’m Melissa, a meditation teacher and the heart behind Homebody Practice.

I believe meditation doesn’t have to look a certain way to be meaningful. My approach is relational and real, grounded in conversation, shaped by curiosity, and rooted in the understanding that connection is always available, even when we forget.

Melissa's sessions, whether one-on-one or in community, Melissa uses breath and guided imagery to help you remember your capacity for self-connection. She believes meditation is an invitation to rediscover that you already carry what you need.
